# File-scoped namespace declaration

File scoped namespace declarations enable you to declare that all types in a file are in a single namespace. File scoped namespace declarations are available with C# 10.0.

[Here](FileScopedNamespaces/ProductRepository.cs:1) we define namespace `MyNamespaces` that will be used as a namespace for all definitions in the file. All you need to do is to [use it](FileScopedNamespaces/Program.cs:1) as regular namespace.
