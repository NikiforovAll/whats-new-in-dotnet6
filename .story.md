# Minimal API

Minimal APIs are a low ceremony way to build small microservices and HTTP APIs in ASP.NET Core. Minimal APIs hook into ASP.NET Coreâ€™s hosting and routing capabilities and allow you to create fully functioning APIs with just a few lines of code.

[You use](MinimalAPI/Program.cs:1) the builder to create an app and then you run the app, this is known as the builder pattern.

The [app](MinimalAPI/Program.cs:8) object is what you use to [build application pipeline](MinimalAPI/Program.cs:9-11) and [route URLs](MinimalAPI/Program.cs:13) to code.

You can route to handlers using the various `Map*` methods on `WebApplication`. There's a `Map{HTTPMethod}` method to allow handling different HTTP methods.

In our example, we provide a service that [checks](MinimalAPI/Program.cs:13) if provided number is a power of 2 and returns `true` or `false` based on the calculation.

**Note**, `IsPow2` is a new method added to .NET 6 that is used through static import [IsPow2](MinimalAPI/MinimalAPI.csproj:14).
