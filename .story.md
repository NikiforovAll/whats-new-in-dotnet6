# Global usings

C# 10.0 allows you to define using directives globally, so that you donâ€™t have to write them in every file.

You can apply two modifiers to a using directive:

* The global modifier has the same effect as adding the same using directive to every source file in your project. This modifier was introduced in C# 10.0.
* The static modifier imports the static members and nested types from a single type rather than importing all the types in a namespace. This modifier was introduced in C# 6.0.

Adding the [global modifier](GlobalUsings/GlobalUsings.cs:1-7) to a using directive means that using is applied to all files in the compilation (typically a project)

The global modifier may be combined with the [static modifier](GlobalUsings/GlobalUsings.cs:9). The global modifier may be applied to a using alias directive. In both cases, the directive's scope is all files in the current compilation.

You can also globally include a namespace by adding a `Using` item to [your project file](GlobalUsings/GlobalUsings.csproj:11).

## SDKs support

The .NET 6 SDK also adds a set of implicit global using directives for projects that use the following SDKs:

* Microsoft.NET.Sdk
* Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web
* Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Worker

Basically, we don't needed to add [implicit usings](GlobalUsings/GlobalUsings.cs:1-7) because they are included as part of `Microsoft.NET.Sdk`. You can control this feature based on [ImplicitUsings](GlobalUsings/GlobalUsings.csproj:6) MSBuild property.
