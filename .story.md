# PriorityQueue

Before we get started, it's worth talking about what exactly a Priority Queue is. A Priority Queue is a Queue, where each item holds a "priority" that can be compared against other queue items. When an item is dequeued, the item with the highest priority is popped off the queue, regardless of when it was put on.

Priority Queues have many uses, but are most commonly seen when doing work with “graph traversals” as you are able to quickly identify nodes which have the highest/lowest "cost" etc.

In [this example](PriorityQueue/Program.cs:3-19), we schedule 10 jobs with a random priority and [process them](PriorityQueue/Program.cs:15-18) by using `PriorityQueue{Job, int}`. Note, you can use [custom comparer](PriorityQueue/Program.cs:23-36) `IComparer{T}` to specify the priority. In this case, we want jobs with the higher priority to be processed first.
