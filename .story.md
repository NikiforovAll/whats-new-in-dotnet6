# LINQ Improvements

## Chunking

[Chunking](Linq/Program.cs:14) is a simple concept of splitting a large collection into several smaller chunks. Previously, when you wanted to chunk large collections you had to use loops and conditional logic to implement custom chunking functionality. Thankfully, .NET 6 LINQ now supports it in a single line.

In [this](Linq/Program.cs:17-22) example we split a collection of 100 orders and [calculate total](Linq/Program.cs:19) quantity for each chunk.

## Index Support for ElementAt

Now, you can use `System.Index` to [access item](Linq/Program.cs:28) via `ElementAt`.

## Range Support for Take

You can use [Take](Linq/Program.cs:36) and provide `System.Range` argument to get an access to a subset of source `IEnumerable{T}`.

## Three way zip

Previously, LINQ offered .NET developers a Zip method that would allow them to enumerate through two collections in parallel. LINQ now has an additional overload that allows [three collections](Linq/Program.cs:48) to work in tandem.

## Default Parameters for Common Methods

.NET 6 allows you to specify a [custom parameter](Linq/Program.cs:58) to use in case nothing matches the condition. This avoids having to deal with null values, and instead specifies a safe alternative.

## TryGetNonEnumeratedCount

When working with LINQ, youâ€™re not always working with a `List` or other type of collection that makes it easy to count the length. In fact, when working with certain types of collections, such as those implementing IQueryable, even a simple operation like calling the Count() method may cause the entire query to be re-evaluated.

To combat this, .NET 6 adds the very specialized [TryGetNonEnumeratedCount](Linq/Program.cs:66) method.

## MaxBy and MinBy

.NET 6 gives .NET developers the `MinBy` and `MaxBy` extension methods in LINQ. These two methods allow you to look at your collection and find the largest or smallest of something, based on a specific [arrow function you provide](Linq/Program.cs:73).
