# DateOnly and TimeOnly

The types are pretty much self-explanatory with regards to what they represent. We can use `DateOnly` when we need to represent a date without a time component. For example, perhaps we represent someoneâ€™s date of birth in our application. In such cases, we rarely need to utilise the time portion of a DateTime.

The `TimeOnly` struct is used to represent a time that is independent of the date. For example, imagine creating an alarm clock app that lets the user create a reoccurring alarm. In this situation, we want to store the time of day when the alarm should sound, but the date is irrelevant. The `TimeOnly` type has several constructor overloads. The more common ones that I expect most developers will use allow us to create a date accepting either the hour and minute for the time, the hour, minute and second, or the hour, minute, second and millisecond.
