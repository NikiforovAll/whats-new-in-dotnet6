# Record Structs

Beginning with C# 9, you use the record keyword to define a reference type that provides built-in functionality for encapsulating data. While records can be mutable, they're primarily intended for supporting immutable data models.

A record or a record class declares a reference type. The class keyword is optional, but can [add clarity](RecordStructs/Program.cs:2) for readers. A record struct declares a value type.

In C# 10.0 and later, you can define record struct types using either [positional parameters](RecordStructs/Program.cs:11), or standard [property syntax](RecordStructs/Program.cs:13-18).

Record structs can be mutable as well, both [positional record](RecordStructs/Program.cs:20) structs and record structs with [no positional parameters](RecordStructs/Program.cs:22-27).
